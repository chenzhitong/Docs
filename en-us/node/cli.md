Send to the specified address transfer parameters are: asset ID, the other party address, transfer amount, fee | need to open the wallet |

The following commands is explained in detail:

ðŸ‘‰ `rebuild index`

Rebuild the wallet index. Why is it necessary to rebuild the wallet index?

There is a field in the wallet that records the height of the current wallet sync block. For each new one, the wallet client synchronizes the blocks and updates the assets and transactions in the wallet. Assuming that the currently recorded block height is 100, then you execute the import key command to import the private key, and the wallet still calculates your asset from the block height of 100. If the imported address has some transactions when the block height is less than 100, the transactions and the corresponding assets will not be reflected in the purse, so the wallet index should be rebuilt, forcing the wallet to calculate your assets from the block height of 0.
