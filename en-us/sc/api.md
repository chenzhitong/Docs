# Smart Contract API Reference

<<<<<<< HEAD
The API of the Empty Smart Contract expands the capabilities of the Smart Contract to access the blockchain data, manipulate the persistent store, and execute the execution environment. It is part of the Anto Virtual Machine (AVM) Interoperability Service Layer.

For information about AVM, see [Ants Smart Contract Tutorial](tutorial.md).
=======
The NEO Smart Contract API expands the capabilities of the Smart Contract to access the blockchain data, manipulate persistent storage, and query the execution environment. It is part of the Neo Virtual Machine (NeoVM) Interoperability Service Layer.

For information about NeoVM, see [NEO Smart Contract Tutorial](tutorial.md).
