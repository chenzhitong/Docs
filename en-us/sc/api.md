# Smart Contract API Reference

The API of the Empty Smart Contract expands the capabilities of the Smart Contract to access the blockchain data, manipulate the persistent store, and execute the execution environment. It is part of the Anto Virtual Machine (AVM) Interoperability Service Layer.

For information about AVM, see [Ants Smart Contract Tutorial](tutorial.md).

For more information on how to use the framework to easily call APIs in high-level languages, see [Ants Smart Contracts Framework](fw.md).
