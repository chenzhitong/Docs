# Smart contract framework

The smart contract framework provides consistent APIs across several programming languages that programmers can use to manipulate state on the blockchain.

The current smart contract framework supports [.net framework](fw/dotnet.md) and java, and its compiler will be released within a few months. In the future this compiler will also support Python, C/C ++, and Go.
